 Ms. Jessica Hallek is the well-liked biology teacher for Hunderson's High School, as well as camp director for the APSMAT (Advanced Placement Science, Math, Art, Technogoly). She has lead these for the past four years ever snice she finished her education. She uses the StormGuard Website so that she can decide if her kids can learn outside, among life, rather than jsut learning about it. For her APSMAT she utilizes the website as she prepares for their outside work and play for the day.
 She says that if there is one thing that she wishes all her students and kids would take away from her is that: "Life isn't just for living or learning. It's for loving, and if we spread a little love, then life will seem a little more green."
