            Ms. Jessica Hallek is the well-liked biology teacher for Henderson's High School. Aged only 26, Jessica has
            a way of connecting with her students that makes science not only interesting but also fun.,as well as camp
            director for the APSMAT (Advanced Placement Science, Math, Art, Technology). She has led these for the past
            four years ever since she finished her education. She uses the StormGuard Website so that she can decide if
            her kids can learn outside, among life, rather than just learning about it. For her APSMAT she utilizes the
            website as she prepares for their outside work and plays for the day, particularly as she looks on her
            laptop or tablet to get the latest details in her daily forecast.
            She says that if there is one thing that she wishes all her students and kids would take away from her is
            that: "Life isn't just for living or learning. It's for loving, and if we spread a little love, then life
            will seem a little more green."
