        Here at StormGuard our purpose is to warn people of storms, natural disasters such as hurricanes and do our best
        to prepare them for the storms. We offer advice in storm preparedness, such as the do’s and don’ts to do in a
        variety of storms, things that you can do, as a community, as a family and as an individual to try and protect
        your homes and yourself during storms. With accurate hourly, daily, five-day, and weekly warnings we hope to
        give time to formulate plans for yourself and your family’s safety. As part of services we give accurate hourly,
        daily, and future forecast and radar for temperature, humidity, and precipitation, so that you can plan for the
        day. </P>
