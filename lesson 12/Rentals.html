                                    tires, you might feel skeptical about its performance. But the height, solid axles,
                                    and
                                    locking rear differentials can help with city driving.
                                    With the touch of a button, the top retracts, allowing sunlight in. The windows and
                                    doors
                                    are also quick and easy to remove. In a matter of minutes, you can connect with
                                    nature and
                                    have the ultimate beach SUV. </p>
