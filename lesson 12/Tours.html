            <h4> A breif History of the Island of Cozumel, Mexico</h4>
            <p>
                The Maya are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early part of the 1st millennium AD, and
                older Preclassic Olmec artifacts have been found on the island as well. The island was sacred to Ix
                Chel, the Maya Moon Goddess, and the temples here were a place of pilgrimage, especially by women
                desiring fertility. There are a number of ruins on the island, most from the Post-Classic period.
                The largest Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and have now been destroyed. Today,
                the largest remaining ruins are at San Gervasio, located approximately at the center of the island.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first Spanish expedition to visit Cozumel was led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518. In the
                following year Hernán Cortés stopped by the island on his way to Veracruz. The Grijalva and
                Cortés expeditions were both received peacefully by the Maya of Cozumel, unlike the expeditions'
                experiences on other parts of the mainland. Even after Cortés destroyed some of the Maya idols on
                Cozumel and replaced them with an image of the Virgin Mary, the native inhabitants of the island
                continued to help the Spanish re-supply their ships with food and water so they could continue their
                voyages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1848, refugees escaping the tumult of the Caste War of Yucatán settled on the island and in 1849 the
                town of San Miguel de Cozumel was officially recognized by the Mexican government.

                In 1861, American President Abraham Lincoln ordered his Secretary of State, William Henry Seward, to
                meet with the Mexican chargé d'affaires Matias Romero to explore the possibility of purchasing the
                island of Cozumel for the purpose of relocating freed American slaves offshore. The idea was summarily
                dismissed by Mexican President Benito Juarez, but in 1862 Lincoln did manage to establish a short-lived
                colony of ex-slaves on Île à Vache off the coast of Haiti.
