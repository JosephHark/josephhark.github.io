            Even in our day and age of getting things almost instantly there are still people who go to bed hungry and are without access to clean water. Almost 815 million people who go to bed hungry and 785 million who suffer from dirty water. And despite the effort of global relief groups that number goes up when natural disaster strike, the effects of such even worse in areas with few or poorly kept roads.
