            <p>The woman is standing on the right thrid of the picture, this allows one to get a good veiw of her body
                without cover the background. Her face, situated at the first third from the bottom, draws your eyes in
                even more. </p>

            <p> There is both large and small contrast in this picture. On the half on the left half there are darker
                elements against the lighter wall, the opposite being for the other half. Even the light lettering
                against the darker half is evidence of the principle of contrast.</p>
