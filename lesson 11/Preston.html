                        the
                        following CDC suggestions for Thanksgiving. </h4>
                    <p><strong>Travel</strong>
                        Travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. Postponing travel and staying
                        home is the best way to protect yourself and others this year.
                        Check travel restrictions before you go.
                        Get your flu shot before you travel.
                        Always wear a mask in public settings, when using public transportation, and when around people
                        who you donâ€™t live with.
                        Stay at least 6 feet apart from anyone who does not live with you.
                        Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer.
                        Avoid touching your mask, eyes, nose, and mouth.
                        Bring extra supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer.
                        Know when to delay your travel.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Wear a mask</strong>
                        Wear a mask with two or more layers to help protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
                        Wear the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.
                        Make sure the mask fits snugly against the sides of your face.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-para-2">
                    <p><strong>Stay at least 6 feet away from others who do not live with you</strong>
                        Remember that people without symptoms may be able to spread COVID-19 or flu.
                        Keeping 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from others is especially important for people who are at
                        higher risk of getting very sick.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Wash your hands</strong>
                        Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
                        Keep hand sanitizer with you and use it when you are unable to wash your hands.
                        Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Attending a Gathering</strong>
                        Celebrating virtually or with the people you live with is the safest choice this Thanksgiving.
                        Bring your own food, drinks, plates, cups, and utensils.
                        Wear a mask and safely store your mask while eating and drinking.
                        Avoid going in and out of the areas where food is being prepared or handled, such as in the
                        kitchen.
                        Use single-use options, like salad dressing and condiment packets, and disposable items like
                        food containers, plates, and utensils.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Consider Other Thanksgiving Activities</strong>
                        Schedule a time to share a meal together virtually.
                        Have people share recipes and show their turkey, dressing, or other dishes they prepared.
                        Watch Thanksgiving Day parades, sports, and movies at home.
                        Find a fun game to play.
                        Shop online sales the day after Thanksgiving and days leading up to the winter holidays.
                        Use contactless services for purchased items, like curbside pick-up.
                        Shop in open air markets staying 6 feet away from others and wear a mask.
